			Differences between this and previous version should be hidden
			to users. Main changes were done in design of source code. I
			will try to explain <I>what it is</I> and <I>why it is done this
			way</I>? Main goal was to clean and minimalize source code,
			remove several global variables, move everything concerned with
			help to these files.
		</P>
		<P>
			The help system is based on bi-directional list of help screens. 
			Each help screen has defined two variables, help text (<I>char
			*hlptxt</I>) and number of lines of help text (<I>int
			hlplns</I>).  Since this version the help file can/should be
			separated from *rc files. Advantage of this model is that you
			can set help to other languages. Usage of standard method
			(gettext) will be very difficult here, because help has constant
			width which can't be overcrossed. This method has also no
			problem with having several help files in each language (for
			joe, jmacs, ...). Problematics of setting proper help file will
			be solved in <I>main.c</I> not here.
