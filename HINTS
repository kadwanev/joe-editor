This documentation should go elsewhere, but I haven't gotten around to it
yet.

UTF-8
-----

	JOE will send UTF-8 sequences to the screen and accept UTF-8
sequences from the keyboard if you have the LC_ALL environment variable set
to a UTF_8 locale:

	export LC_ALL=en_IN.utf-8

	Of course the terminal emulator needs to be UTF-8 compatible as
well.

	Furthermore, if the locale is UTF-8, JOE assumes files are UTF-8
encoded as well.

	If the locale is not UTF-8, JOE assumes files are not UTF-8.

	If you hit ^T U, JOE will change its assumption about the encoding
of the file, and translate to the coding of the terminal using iconv().  If
the terminal is utf-8, ^T U will switch the file encoding to the locale with
the ".utf-8" removed- this is a guess as to the most likely byte encoding of
in use at the locale.

	Use ` x to enter a Unicode character in hex.

	Hit ^K <space> to see the Unicode of the character under the cursor.

Programming
-----------

	Try ^K , and ^K .  These keys select the current block (based on
indentation) and shift it left or right by the -istep and -indentc.
