PROGRAMMER ChangeLog
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
** JOE 2.9.4 :: 27 Mar 2001
	- FEATURE:: locale is accepted when skipping/deleting/... words
	- changed parts of zstr.c/zstr.h and some others
** JOE 2.9.3 :: 26 Mar 2001
	- changed version number :) to 2.9.3
	- variable helpcursor was renamed to help_index because 
		it contains index of last shown help screen
	- function izhelp was moved from rc.c/rc.h to help.c/help.h
		and variable nhelp (from rc.c) was deleted
	- help.c/help.h are readable now but still not documented enough
		because they depend on rc.c/rc.h; so I must work on them
		first
** JOE 2.9.2 :: 25 Mar 2001
	- function cwhite() was substituted for isblank()
		from <ctype.h>
	- function cwhitel() was substituted for isspace() 
		from <ctype.h>
	- function imax(), umax() were removed
	- functions z*() were substituted for str*()
		from <string.h>
** JOE 2.9.1 :: 23 Mar 2001
	- files random.c and random.h were deleted
		- function random() is from <stdlib.h>
	- functions toup(); todn() were deleted
		- new functions are toupper(), tolower() from <ctype.h>
		  because they support locales (LC_CTYPE)
** JOE 2.9 :: 22 Mar 2001
	- version 2.8 with patches from RedHat/Suse
