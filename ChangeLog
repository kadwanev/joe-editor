	* joe.1, ufile.c: new feature 'backup suffix', when the system

	* b.c, main.c, path.c, path.h, rc.c, ufile.c: Function 'ossep'

	* ufile.c: Problem with freezing when saving unmodified file 
	is solved. But it is possible that this patch is only partial

	* ufile.c: Modified flag is now properly set. It can look
	awful but pre-first undo record has modified flag set on.

	* joe-2.9.7pre0.tgz: version 2.9.7pre0 was released

	* lot of files: I get last version without wordwrap bug (2.9.6pre1) and
	applied almost all patches which are mentioned in NEWS file. Problem
	with ${sysconfdir}/joerc is probably still actual, because I was not
	able to find patch :(
