=-=-=-=-=-=

BuGS

Emacs emulation improvements:
	- Rectangle mode for emacs yank system
	- Overtype mode works for yank
	- Query save loop? for kill-emacs and compile
	- Emacs reload from file function? ^X ^V 
		(it just works out if ^X ^V kills all instances of the buffer)
	- Bufed should display unnamed buffers
	- ESC args should work differently in emacs
	- nextword,nextword,prevword sequence 
		doesn't work for marking next successive word at ends of lines
	- exiting options and i-search with ESC is not pretty
		(it isn't in emacs either)
	- Allow either direct screen access or normal tty support 
		for DOS version.
